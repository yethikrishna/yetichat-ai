## How the Backend Agent Works (High-Level)

The core of the backend is a LangGraph agent defined in `backend/src/agent/graph.py`. It follows these steps:

![Agent Flow](./agent.png)

1.  **Generate Initial Queries:** Based on your input, it generates a set of initial search queries using a Gemini model.
2.  **Web Research:** For each query, it uses the Gemini model with the Google Search API to find relevant web pages.
3.  **Reflection & Knowledge Gap Analysis:** The agent analyzes the search results to determine if the information is sufficient or if there are knowledge gaps. It uses a Gemini model for this reflection process.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** If gaps are found or the information is insufficient, it generates follow-up queries and repeats the web research and reflection steps (up to a configured maximum number of loops).
5.  **Finalize Answer:** Once the research is deemed sufficient, the agent synthesizes the gathered information into a coherent answer, including citations from the web sources, using a Gemini model.

## Deployment

In production, the backend server serves the optimized static frontend build. LangGraph requires a Redis instance and a Postgres database. Redis is used as a pub-sub broker to enable streaming real time output from background runs. Postgres is used to store assistants, threads, runs, persist thread state and long term memory, and to manage the state of the background task queue with 'exactly once' semantics. For more details on how to deploy the backend server, take a look at the [LangGraph Documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/deployment_options/). Below is an example of how to build a Docker image that includes the optimized frontend build and the backend server and run it via `docker-compose`.

_Note: For the docker-compose.yml example you need a LangSmith API key, you can get one from [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/settings)._

_Note: If you are not running the docker-compose.yml example or exposing the backend server to the public internet, you update the `apiUrl` in the `frontend/src/App.tsx` file your host. Currently the `apiUrl` is set to `http://localhost:8123` for docker-compose or `http://localhost:2024` for development._

**1. Build the Docker Image:**

   Run the following command from the **project root directory**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t gemini-fullstack-langgraph -f Dockerfile .
   ```
**2. Run the Production Server:**

   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key> LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your_langsmith_api_key> docker-compose up
   ```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8123/app/` to see the application. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8123`.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)) - For the frontend user interface.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling.
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - For components.
- [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) - For building the backend research agent.
- [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini) - LLM for query generation, reflection, and answer synthesis.

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Frontend (Static Site)
- **Netlify** (Recommended): [Deploy Guide](./NETLIFY_DEPLOY.md)
- **Vercel**: Similar to Netlify, upload `frontend/dist` folder
- **GitHub Pages**: Upload built files to gh-pages branch

### Backend (API Server)
- **Railway**: Easy one-click deployment
- **Heroku**: Classic platform with free tier
- **Railway**: Modern platform with generous free tier
- **Docker**: Use included Dockerfile for any platform

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **API Key Required**: You need a free Google Gemini API key - [Get it here](./GET_API_KEY.md)
2. **Frontend Only**: Netlify deployment only hosts the frontend - backend needed separately
3. **Free Tiers**: Both Google Gemini and deployment platforms offer generous free tiers

## Quick Start Instructions

Follow these steps to get your project running:

1.  **Set up your Gemini API Key:**
    *   Open the `backend/.env` file.
    *   Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Google Gemini API key. You can get your free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

2.  **Install Dependencies and Compile:**
    Open your terminal and run the following command from the root of the project:
    ```bash
    pip install -e ./backend && npm install --prefix frontend
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    After the installation is complete, run the following command:
    ```bash
    make dev
    ```
    This will start both the backend and frontend development servers. You should then be able to access your agent in your browser.
